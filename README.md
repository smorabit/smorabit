I am a computational biologist using genomics approaches to decipher human diseases. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Single Cell Genomics Group](https://www.cnag.eu/teams/genome-research-unit/single-cell-genomics-team) at the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico [(CNAG)](https://www.cnag.eu/) in Barcelona, Spain. Previously I did my PhD in the [lab of Dr. Vivek Swarup](https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). You can learn more about me and my research at [my website](https://smorabit.github.io).
